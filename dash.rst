=============
The Dashboard
=============

The `Scrapinghub Dashboard`_ allows you to control and monitor your spiders, as well as other Scrapinghub services such as Crawlera.

When you login to Scrapinghub, you go to your home page (also known as your profile page). There you can see all your Scrapy Cloud projects and Crawlera users:

Organizations
=============

Before you create your first project, you will need to create an organization. An organization represents a group of users collaborating on one or more projects. To create an organization, click the 'Create an organization' button at the top right of the Scrapinghub homepage. You can only have one trial organization, and once its has expired you will no longer be able to create projects under that organization. If you create a project before having created an organization, you can choose 'Create a default Scrapy Cloud trial organization' and a default organization will be created using your username.

Billing is done per organization, so if you are using a paid account you will receive a separate invoice for each organization you own. You can invite users to your organization's project without them belonging to the organization. If you need other people to be able to create projects under your organization, you can add them as a manager:

If you want to upgrade to a paid account, you can do so on your organization's billing page:

Crawlera accounts are linked to organizations rather than users. When signing up for Crawlera your user will be linked to your organization. If you wish to move a Crawlera user to a different organization, please contact support. 

The Search Bar
==============

You can use the search bar to jump quickly to any project, user or Crawlera account.

Jobs Dashboard
==============

The **Jobs** dashboard can be used to monitor and control your spiders.

To schedule a spider for running select the spider in the **Schedule** box and click the `Schedule` button.

If you click on any project, you go to the **Jobs** dashboard page where you will see the spider jobs that are completed, running or pending to run.

.. image:: _static/dash-jobs.png

|

* **Pending Jobs** - the list of jobs that are waiting to start. Jobs may not start immediately after being scheduled, sometimes they must wait for resources to be available. If you need better capacity guarantees, consider purchasing a dedicated server.

* **Running Jobs** - the list of jobs that are currently running.

* **Completed Jobs** - the latest completed jobs.


Job Page
========

Clicking on any job ID (see the picture above) will take you to the job page, where you can see stats about the job alongside items scraped from it:

Job Outcomes
============

The job outcome indicates whether the job succeeded or failed. By default, it contains the value of the spider close reason from Scrapy. It's available in the table of completed jobs:

Here is a summary of the most common job outcomes. Click on the name for more
details:

==========================   ===============================================================
Outcome                      Meaning
==========================   ===============================================================
`finished`_                  the job finished OK
`no_reason`_                 the job finished OK but didn't set an outcome
`failed`_                    the job failed to start
`cancelled`_                 the job was cancelled from Scrapinghub Dashboard or API
`cancel_timeout`_            the job failed to shutdown gracefully after cancellation
`shutdown`_                  the job was cancelled from Scrapy code
`memusage_exceeded`_         the job was cancelled due to high memory usage
`banned`_                    the job was cancelled because target site banned the spider
`slybot_fewitems_scraped`_   the job was not scraping enough data (:doc:`portia` specific)
closespider_errorcount       set by `Scrapy CloseSpider extension`_
closespider_pagecount        set by `Scrapy CloseSpider extension`_
closespider_timeout          set by `Scrapy CloseSpider extension`_
closespider_itemcount        set by `Scrapy CloseSpider extension`_
==========================   ===============================================================

finished
--------

The job finished successfully. However, it may have produced errors, which you
can inspect through the logs.

no_reason
---------

The job finished successfully but did not set an outcome explicitly. For Scrapy
jobs the outcome is taken from the spider close reason (which defaults to
`finished`_) but on non-Scrapy jobs this is not the case and jobs will get this
outcome.

failed
------

The job failed to start, typically due to a bug in the spider's code. Check the
last lines of the job log for more information.

cancelled
---------

The job was cancelled from :ref:`the dashboard <dash>`, the :ref:`API <api>` or
by the system if it got inactive and failed to produce anything (not even log
entries) for an hour.

cancel_timeout
--------------

The job has failed to shutdown gracefully after cancellation (taking more than
5 minutes).

shutdown
--------

The spider was cancelled prematurely, typically from code. `shutdown`_ is the
default close reason (outcome) used by Scrapy for such cases. It is what you
get, for example, when you cancel a Scrapy spider pressing ``Ctrl-C``.

memusage_exceeded
-----------------

The job was consuming too much memory, exceeding the limit (512 Mb by default),
and it was cancelled by the system. This typically happens with spiders that
don't use memory efficiently (keeping state or references that grow quickly
over time) and it's most often manifested on long spider runs of many pages.
This outcome is triggered by Scrapy's `Memory Usage Extension`_.

banned
------

The job was termianted because the spider got banned from the target website.
This outcome is often set by the Crawlera extension.

slybot_fewitems_scraped
-----------------------

The job was cancelled because it wasn't scraping enough new data. This is used
in :ref:`portia` to prevent infinite crawling loops.

Items Browser
=============

You can review items by clicking on the **Items** tab:

You can also download the items in CSV or JSON format through the **Items** menu:
